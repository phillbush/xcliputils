XCLIPD(1)                   General Commands Manual                  XCLIPD(1)

NAME
     xclipd â€“ clipboard manager daemon

SYNOPSIS
     xclipd

DESCRIPTION
     xclipd maintains the contents of the CLIPBOARD selection, making it
     possible to copy the contents of a window into the clipboard and to close
     that window without losing the copied content.

     xclipd also keeps the PRIMARY selection synchronized with the CLIPBOARD
     selection.  Whenever something is copied into the CLIPBOARD selection,
     that content can also be requested from the PRIMARY selection as well,
     but not the other way around.

     xclipd does not daemonize itself; therefore, it should be run in the
     background.

ENVIRONMENT
     The following environment variables affect the execution of xclipd.

     DISPLAY
             The display to start xclipd on.
